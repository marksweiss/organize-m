Organize-m aims for one sweet spot -- fast and useful command-line operation seamlessly combined with editing of organizer items in an editor.

Add, delete and find items from the command line, switch to your editor to add a longer note to an item.  Switch back to find and display that item and the others in its project -- if that sounds like how you work, or might want to work, then Organize-m is for you.

The Organize-m command-line interface is simple and intuitive:

> python orgm.py --add --title 'my item title' --project 'my project' --tags 'tag 1, tag 2' --actions 'do this now, do this later' --due_date '5-5-2010'
> python orgm.py --find --regex --title 'my proj*'

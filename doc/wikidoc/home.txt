*Organize-m* is a TODO tool lets you seamlessly move from command line to text editor and back.  Simple but versatile, just structured enough but very flexible.  It gets out of your way and fits the way you work.

Add, delete and find items from the command line, switch to your editor to add a longer note to an item.  Switch back to find and display that item and the others in its project -- if that sounds like how you work, or might want to work, then Organize-m is for you.

*Examples*
Add, delete and find items from the command line, switch to your editor to add a longer note to an item.  Switch back to find and display that item and all others in its project.  Then run a short command to show your next due item.  Organize-m offers the right primitives and to build your own workflows.

The Organize-m command-line interface is simple and intuitive:

@> python orgm.py --add --title "my item title" --project "my project" --tags "tag 1, tag 2" --actions "do this now, do this later" --due_date "5-5-2010"@
@> python orgm.py --find --regex --title "my proj*"@

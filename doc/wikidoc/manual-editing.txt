The Organize-m data format for items looks like this:

@- item:@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- title: 'My Title'@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- area: 'My Area'@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- project: 'My Project'@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- tags: 'Tag 1, Tag 2'@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- actions: 'Action 1, Action 2'@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- due: '5-5-2010'@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- note: |@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@My Note on multiple lines and lines@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@and lines and lines@<br/>
    
Item data is stored in the file @orgm.dat.@  You can edit it in a text editor and changes made will be available to the command line the next time it's run.  Likewise item changes such as adding or removing items will change orgm.dat.

The data is stored in YAML format.  YAML is lightly structured, so the file is easily readable and edited.  But it *is* structured -- new items you had must follow the format above.  In particular:
* The item element fields title through note above must be in the same order in any new item you create
* The root 'item' field must be called that, and each child element field, 'title', 'area', etc., must also be called by the same name
* Values for @title, area, project@ and @due_date@ are one-line strings.  These should be enclosed in single or double quotes for safest operation, even though YAML doesn't require this
* Values for @tags@ and @actions@ are multi-value lists, enclosed in quotes with items separated by commas.  You must write them this way.
* @due_date@ doesn't have any special date handling at this time.
* @note@ is a special YAML multi-line field.  This means it can contain arbitrary text of any number of lines desired.  However, each line must be indented six spaces.

If you know you need a new item, but it includes a long note or some other feature most easily created in your editor, you can use the @add_empty@ command as a convenience.  run @--add_empty@ from the command line and then switch to the editor.  Your new empty item is waiting at the bottom of the file.

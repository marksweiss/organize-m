The Organize-m data format for items looks like this:

@- item:@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- title: Do something about coal-powered electrical plants@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- area: world climate@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- project: save my children's future on Earth@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- tags: ['world climate, children']@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- actions: ['write congressman, join organizatin promoting alternative energy']@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- due_date: 1-1-2012@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@- note: |@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@My Note on multiple lines and lines@<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@and lines and lines@<br/>
    
Item data is stored in the file @orgm.dat.@  You can edit it in a text editor and changes made will be available to the command line the next time it's run.  Likewise item changes such as adding or removing items will change orgm.dat.

The data is stored in YAML format.  YAML is lightly structured, so the file is easily readable and edited.  But it *is* structured -- new items you had must follow the format above.  

In particular:
* The root @item@ field must be called that
* Each child element field -- @title@, @area@, @project@, @tags@, @actions@, @due_date@ and @note@ -- must be called by the names shown here and appear in the order shown here
* Values for @title, area, project@ and @due_date@ are one-line strings. Do _not_ enclose these in single or double quotes.
* Values for @tags@ and @actions@ are multi-value lists, enclosed in square brackets, with single or double quotes around each item, with items separated by commas.
* @due_date@ doesn't have any special date handling at this time.
* @note@ is a special YAML multi-line field.  This means it can contain arbitrary text of any number of lines desired.  However, each line must be indented six spaces.  An editor with YAML support will indent each line as you create it.

If you know you need a new item, but it includes a long note or some other feature most easily created in your editor, you can use the @add_empty@ command as a convenience.  run @--add_empty@ from the command line and then switch to the editor.  Your new empty item is waiting at the bottom of the file.
